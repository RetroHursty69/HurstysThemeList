Every theme I have made (that I can remember) and shared with the gaming community.
EmulationStation, Attract Mode, Batocera/RetroBat.
URL's are in the text document.
I am not really making or updating themes any more, but I am open to making 'small' changes.
Making themes became an obsession and I enjoy creating.

Huge thanks to anyone who has helped me learn over the years with this hobby.
David Marty however, is not only a great bloke, but none of these themes would have happened if he didn't help me get started. He has also been extremely generous and helpfull to me over a long time now.

If you want to have a crack at creating your own EmulationStation Theme, I made a video to try and help you get started:
